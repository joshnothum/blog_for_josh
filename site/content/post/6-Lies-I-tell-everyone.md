* I'm totally listening to you.
* Of course 'Moonlight' deserved Best Picture.
* I was just joking when I called people from Nepal, 'Napoleons.'  That was just a joke. I didn't actually think that. It had nothing     to do with my public school education.
* You're right! Your dog <b>_IS_</b> different than everyone else's dog.
* I sell my blood for money? To buy beer? Who told you that? That's ridiculous.
* I think asking to speak with a manger because vegan options aren't on the menu is courageous. I'm proud to be seen with you while you   take a such a brave stance.
