* You're right! Your dog __IS__ different than everyone else's dog.
* Of course 'Moonlight' deserved Best Picture.
* I'm totally listening to you.
* I was just joking when I called people from Nepal, Napoleons.  That was just a joke. I didn't actually think that. Just a joke. It had nothing to do with my public school education.
* Sell blood for money? To buy beer? Who told you that? That's ridiculous.
* I think asking to speak to a restaurant manger because they don't have vegan options is courageous. I'm proud to be seen with you while you take a such a brave stance.
