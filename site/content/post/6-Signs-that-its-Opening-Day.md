* Target Field has people in it.
* The weather report puts that fun little baseball in the corner of the daily forecast.
* Everyone skips work (only in St. Louis).
* Everyone wonders why I skipped work (only in Minneapolis).
* The word 'pastime' trends on Twitter for a non-racist reason.
* I am not lying (or quoting [Ice Cube](https://youtu.be/h4UqMyldS7Q)) when I say 'Today was a good day.'
