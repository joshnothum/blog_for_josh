* I don't have a girlfriend. But I do know a woman who would be mad at me for saying that.
* My friend asked me if I wanted a frozen banana I said 'No, but I want a regular banana later so... yeah.'
* Dane Cook
* I'm against picketing, but I don't know how to show it.
* I like rice, rice is great when you're hungry and you want 2,000 of something.
* I'm sick of following my dreams. I'm just gonna ask them where they're going and catch up with them later.
